##Animal Shelter

###Part One
An animal shelter needs to track the feeding of their cats and dogs. They want a computer program where they can enter the animals, note each time the animal gets fed, and see which animals have been fed on the current day. This shelter only feeds their animals once per day, and the program should help the keepers from feeding the animals too much. Write this program in JavaScript and Ruby, with no database. If you're short on time, only write the models (no user interface).

###Part Two
Now, add a database to your Ruby version. Use SQL without ActiveRecord.
