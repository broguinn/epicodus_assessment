##Leap Year

Solve the [Leap Year](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/leap-year) problem, using TDD, in javascript and ruby.

[Leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_years) are divisible by 4 (like 1992 and 1996). There is an exception, though, and an exception to the exception: if a year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year (like 1900), unless it is also divisible by 400 (like the year 2000).

Don't be afraid to reference my Pig Latin example to get your code set up and your tests working. I regularly look at code I've written before and other people's code to remind myself how to do something.
