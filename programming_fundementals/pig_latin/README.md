##Pig Latin

Solve the [Pig Latin](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/pig-latin) problem, using TDD, in javascript and ruby.

Ready for something a little harder? Write your own Pig Latin translator. Don't look at the code that I started (but feel free to reference your Leap Year project). Make sure you deal with words that start with multiple consonants and 'qu'. When you've got it working for one word, make it work for multiple words (the `split()` method for strings will come in handy - check the [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)).
